# Destination Ratr

## Overview 
A collaborative project and single-page application where users can rate and post their travel experiences in a blog-like manner. This full stack CRUD application was built with class-based React on the frontend and PHP on the backend. Additionally, we created our own API database with PostgreSQL. The PHP backend was deployed with Heroku and the front-end was deployed with Netlify.

## Approach Taken
We wanted to create a platform where users are able to create a collage of photos from their travel experiences. We first decided to build out the backend and then build out the frontend while adding additional features as we went along.

## Next Steps
- Adding authentication in order to provide a unique experience for each user
