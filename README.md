# Destination_Ratr

Link to live site: https://destination-ratr.netlify.app/

Functionality: Created a Full Stack application that utilizes a PHP backend with PostgreSQL as the backend and react as the frontend. This app allows users to create their favorite trips. Users can utilize full CRUD on the app. This app is deployed via heroku. 

Technologies used: PostgreSQL, PHP, React, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap

Approach taken: Our approach was that we wanted a fully functional site to hold reviews for trips/destinations. 

Unsolved problems: The next step in our project would be to add authentication.
